# Shiba Inu Records Unprecedented Growth in Holder Base  

## Rapid Expansion of Shiba Inu's Community  

Shiba Inu (SHIB) has achieved a remarkable milestone, surpassing **1.145 million wallet holders** â€“ the highest number in its history. This surge in adoption underscores the growing popularity of the meme-inspired cryptocurrency within the blockchain ecosystem. WhaleStats, a leading blockchain analytics platform, confirmed the development through its official Twitter channels, highlighting SHIB's dominance among Ethereum-based assets.  

The platform also revealed that the top 1,000 Ethereum wallets collectively hold a significant portion of SHIB, solidifying its position as a preferred altcoin for high-net-worth Ethereum investors. This trend reflects broader market confidence in SHIB's utility and long-term potential.  

## Shiba Inu vs. BabyDoge: A Competitive Landscape  

Just days prior to this milestone, SHIB held **1,140,151 wallet owners**, trailing behind its meme coin counterpart BabyDoge, which boasted **1,226,253 wallets**. Despite BabyDoge's lead in holder count, SHIB maintains a critical advantage in **market capitalization** and **trading volume**, positioning it as the more liquid and widely accepted asset between the two.  

This competitive dynamic highlights the evolving preferences of cryptocurrency investors, who increasingly prioritize market stability and transactional efficiency alongside community-driven appeal.  

## Strategic Developments: The Rise of Shibarium  

Shiba Inu's momentum in 2022 is further bolstered by its upcoming **Shibarium blockchain**, a layer-2 scaling solution designed to reduce transaction fees and enhance network scalability. This initiative addresses a key challenge for Ethereum-based tokens, which often face congestion and high gas costs during peak usage periods.  

By leveraging Shibarium, SHIB aims to attract both retail and institutional investors seeking cost-effective blockchain transactions. The platform's activation on lending protocol Euler also signals its expanding utility beyond speculative trading.

## Addressing Data Integrity Concerns  

Despite its growth, Shiba Inu faced scrutiny earlier this year when it publicly accused **CoinMarketCap** of listing three unauthorized contract addresses for SHIB. The dispute centered on the platform's inclusion of wormhole addresses for cross-chain transactions, which the SHIB team argued created confusion and security risks for users.  

CoinMarketCap defended its approach, stating these addresses facilitate wrapped asset transactions across blockchains. However, Shytoshi Kusama, a lead developer for Shiba Inu, emphasized the need for platforms to enforce stricter verification processes to prevent scams.  

> "If exchanges allow false contracts without verification, they risk undermining trust in legitimate projects," Kusama tweeted.  

This incident underscores the importance of data accuracy in cryptocurrency ecosystems, where misinformation can lead to significant financial risks for investors.

## What Is Crypto Staking?

Staking involves locking up cryptocurrency to support blockchain operations like transaction validation. In return, participants earn rewards‚Äîoften expressed as annual percentage yields (APYs). This process powers proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchains, offering an eco-friendly alternative to energy-intensive mining. By staking, users contribute to network security while growing their holdings.

### Key Benefits of Staking
- **Passive Income**: Earn rewards without active trading.
- **Network Support**: Enhance blockchain security and decentralization.
- **Low Energy Use**: Environmentally friendly compared to mining.
- **Portfolio Growth**: Compounding rewards can significantly boost asset value over time.

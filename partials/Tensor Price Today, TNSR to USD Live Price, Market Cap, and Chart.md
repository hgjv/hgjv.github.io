## Understanding Tensor (TNSR): A Leader in Blockchain Innovation  

Tensor (TNSR) has emerged as a transformative force in the blockchain and cryptocurrency space, particularly within the **Solana blockchain ecosystem**. At its core, Tensor is a decentralized foundation focused on empowering community-led governance over its protocols. This governance model drives the growth of the **Tensor DAO** (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) and the broader Tensor ecosystem. The foundation actively supports two critical protocols: **Tensor Protocol** and **Vector Protocol**, which serve as foundational trading infrastructures for NFTs on Solana and cross-chain tokens.  

### The Tensor NFT Marketplace: Dominance on Solana  

Launched in July 2022, the **Tensor NFT marketplace** has rapidly claimed 60-70% of Solanaâ€™s NFT market share. Unlike traditional NFT platforms that cater to collectors, Tensor targets **active NFT traders** by offering advanced trading features, real-time data analytics, and a fast, terminal-like interface. This trader-centric approach has been a key driver of its success, enabling users to execute trades efficiently and access market insights instantly.  

### Vector Protocol: Revolutionizing Social Trading  

**Vector Protocol**, Tensorâ€™s sister platform, is a leading social trading application in the crypto space. Within three months of its launch, Vector achieved an annualized trading volume of **$7.5 billion** and attracted **20,000 daily active users**, with both metrics doubling every 1-2 weeks. The app generates **$75 million annually in fees**, with half of these revenues allocated to the **TNSR treasury**. This financial model ensures sustainable growth for the Tensor ecosystem while rewarding token holders through governance and treasury distributions.  

### TNSR Tokenomics: Governance and Treasury Backing  

The **TNSR token** is the backbone of Tensorâ€™s governance framework. It grants holders voting rights over protocol decisions and secures 50% of protocol fees from both Tensor and Vector, which flow into the TNSR treasury. This treasury fuels the foundationâ€™s **grants program**, designed to incentivize the adoption of Tensor protocols by developers, traders, and enterprises.

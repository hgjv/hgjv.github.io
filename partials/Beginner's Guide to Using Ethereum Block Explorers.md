## Step 4: Gas Fee Optimization  

Understanding gas fees is crucial for cost-effective transactions:  
- **Gwei Measurement**: 1 Gwei = 0.000000001 ETH

- **Timing Matters**: Conduct non-urgent transactions during off-peak hours  

Monitor real-time gas estimates on Etherscan's "Gas Tracker" section to avoid overpaying.  

## Blockchain Transparency in Action  

The public nature of blockchain allows anyone to verify:  
- Complete transaction history of any wallet  
- Smart contract code execution  
- Token transfers between addresses  

This transparency builds trust in decentralized systems but also means users must safeguard private keys vigilantly.  

## Frequently Asked Questions

A: Look for the "Success" status indicator and verify the updated balance in the recipient's wallet.  

**Q2: Can I recover funds sent to the wrong address?**  
A: No - blockchain transactions are irreversible. Always double-check addresses before sending.  

**Q3: What does "Pending" status mean?**  
A: The transaction is waiting for miners to include it in a block, which typically takes seconds to minutes.  

**Q4: How do I track NFT transfers?**  
A: Use the "ERC-721 Token Tracker" section on any wallet's Etherscan profile.  

**Q5: Why do gas fees fluctuate?**  
A: Fees depend on network congestion and users' priority settings.

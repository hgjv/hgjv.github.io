## FAQ Section  

### Q1: What Makes SPX6900 Different From Other MemeCoins?

### Q3: How Do I Safely Invest in MemeCoins?  
Allocate 1â€“3% of your crypto portfolio to high-conviction picks like SPX or BONK. Use stop-loss orders to mitigate volatility risks.  

### Q4: Are MemeCoins a Fad or the Future?  
While many projects will fail, tokens with real use cases (e.g., WIF) could survive market cycles.

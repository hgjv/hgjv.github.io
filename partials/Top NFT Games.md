## Understanding NFT Games

NFT (Non-Fungible Token) games integrate blockchain technology to enable true ownership of digital assets such as characters, weapons, virtual land, and skins. Unlike traditional games where assets are controlled by developers, **NFT games** anchor these items on decentralized ledgers, ensuring scarcity, verifiable authenticity, and tradability across marketplaces. Players earn rewards through gameplay, fostering a **play-to-earn** model that bridges entertainment and financial opportunity.

### How Does the Play-to-Earn Model Work?

The **play-to-earn** framework allows players to monetize their time and skills. Key strategies include:
- **Breeding or creating characters** (e.g., Axie Infinity).
- **Purchasing assets** on native or third-party marketplaces.
- **Completing quests or battles** to earn tokens and NFTs.

This model disrupts traditional gaming by redistributing value to players, who can trade assets for cryptocurrencies or fiat. For example, players in the Philippines famously earned livable wages through Axie Infinity during the pandemic, highlighting the socio-economic impact of **blockchain gaming**.

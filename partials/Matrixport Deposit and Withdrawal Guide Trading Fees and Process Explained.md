## Matrixport Deposit Methods Overview

Matrixport offers three primary deposit methods with varying complexity and cost structures:

| Deposit Method       | Difficulty Level | Fee Structure                     |
|----------------------|------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Wallet Transfer      | Easy             | Low (network-dependent)          |
| Bank Wire Transfer    | Difficult        | Lower for large amounts          |
| Third-Party Credit Card | Moderate       | Highest                          |

### Wallet Transfer Deposit Process

This crypto-to-crypto transfer method offers the lowest fees. Follow these steps:

1. Access your Matrixport wallet address:
   - Navigate to **Wallet > Deposit Crypto**
   - Select cryptocurrency and network (e.g., USDT TRC20)

2. Initiate transfer from source exchange:
   - Copy Matrixport's deposit address
   - Use TRC20 network for USDT to minimize fees

**Pro Tip**: Always verify network compatibility before transferring. Sending ETH via ERC20 to a TRC20 address will result in permanent loss.

#### Key Features Implemented
| Enhancement Area | Technical Details |
|------------------|-------------------|
| Transaction Processing | Added cm tx type sorting support |
| Gas Price Optimization | Implemented dynamic gas price recommendations |
| Data Management | Enhanced snapshot creation and data pruning |
| Performance Optimization | Completed IAVL layer performance upgrades |
| Transaction Handling | Enabled mempool nonce skipping functionality |
| RPC Interface | Added tx pool concurrency support in *_SendTransaction |
| Database Operations | Implemented concurrent commit processes for LevelDB |

#### EVM Development
- **Parallel Transaction Execution**: Proof-of-concept development reached 90% completion
- **EIP-1559 Compatibility**: Core implementation at 50% completion
- **Performance Enhancements**: Optimized eth_call execution speed

### Bug Fixes
The development team resolved five critical issues:
1. RPC interface behavior inconsistencies with Ethereum standards
2. Eth_call execution performance optimization
3. Pending transaction data aggregation improvements
4. Exchain-ethers contract deployment fixes
5. Cosmos account transfer limitations resolution

## Security Considerations

As an open-source, decentralized blockchain, OKTC emphasizes user responsibility and technical understanding. Key security advisories include:

1. **Project Evaluation Responsibility**: Users must independently assess project quality and security
2. **Network Access**: Both mainnet and testnet participation remains free
3. **Testnet Caution**: Assets on test environments have no real value
4. **Private Key Management**: Never share private keys or authorize third-party access

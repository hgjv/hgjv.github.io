# Solana Dethrones Core Rivals in Major DEX Volume Ranking

The first half of 2025 marked a transformative period for Solana (SOL), as the high-performance blockchain surged ahead of major competitors in key metrics like Real Economic Value (REV), decentralized exchange (DEX) volume, and Total Value Locked (TVL). Driven by technical innovations, institutional adoption, and a thriving DeFi ecosystem, Solana has positioned itself as a formidable contender in the blockchain space. This article explores the factors behind Solanaâ€™s meteoric rise and its implications for the broader crypto landscape.

## Solanaâ€™s REV Dominance and Jitoâ€™s Role

Solanaâ€™s **Real Economic Value (REV)**â€”a metric measuring demand for blockchain transactions through fees and tipsâ€”has consistently outpaced rivals since October 2024. By January 2025, Solana achieved a REV of **$551 million**, peaking at **$56.8 million in daily REV** on January 19. This milestone eclipsed the combined REV of **Bitcoin (BTC)** and **Ethereum (ETH)**, signaling robust network activity.

### Jitoâ€™s Contribution to Solanaâ€™s Revenue

A significant portion of Solanaâ€™s revenueâ€”**42% to 66% monthlyâ€”comes from Jito**, a protocol enabling cross-chain staking. Jitoâ€™s popularity highlights Solanaâ€™s efficient **Maximum Extractable Value (MEV)** market, where validators capture revenue without inflating median fees. This mechanism allows Solana to handle traffic surges, such as those driven by viral applications like the TRUMP token in January 2025.

### Technical Resilience

Solanaâ€™s network processed **up to 162 million daily transactions** in H1 2025, with an average slot time of **390 milliseconds** and zero downtime since February 2024. Upcoming upgrades like **Alpenglow consensus code** aim to reduce finality to **100â€“150 milliseconds**, lowering validator breakeven capital to **$75,000**. These improvements underscore Solanaâ€™s scalability and reliability.

## TVL Growth and Stablecoin Expansion

While Ethereum remains the DeFi leader with the highest TVL, Solana secured the **second-highest TVL position**, averaging **$8â€“$9 billion** in H1 2025â€”a **18% quarter-over-quarter increase**. This growth aligns with rising institutional interest and the proliferation of DeFi protocols on Solana.

### Stablecoin Surge

The float of stablecoins on Solana exploded from **$1.5 billion to $11.7 billion** over 18 months. **Circle alone minted $1.75 billion in USDC** on Solana in May 2025, reflecting the blockchainâ€™s appeal for fast, low-cost transactions. This stablecoin growth fuels liquidity in Solanaâ€™s DEXs, enhancing its DeFi ecosystem.

## Corporate Treasury Reserve Potential

Cantor Fitzgerald analysts predict Solana could rival **Bitcoin** and **Ethereum** as a corporate treasury reserve asset. Solanaâ€™s **yield-generating staking capabilities** allow companies to earn returns on holdings without diluting equity through share issuance. This model mirrors MicroStrategyâ€™s Bitcoin adoption strategy but with potentially higher yields.

### Institutional Adoption

Public companies are increasingly viewing Solana as a core asset. For instance, **Byreal**, a collaboration between Bybit and Solana, launched its DEX on the network in June 2025, further validating Solanaâ€™s institutional appeal. Analysts cite Solanaâ€™s **capital efficiency** and expanding utility as key drivers for corporate adoption.

## Technical Upgrades and Future Outlook

The **Alpenglow consensus code**, currently in testing, promises to enhance Solanaâ€™s performance by reducing finality times and operational costs. These upgrades will attract developers and users seeking high throughput and low latency, reinforcing Solanaâ€™s position as a Layer 1 blockchain optimized for mass adoption.

## Market Performance and Current Metrics

As of June 2025, **SOL traded at $155.37**, up **4.06% in 24 hours**, reflecting growing investor confidence. Key metrics include:
- **Market Cap**: $80.93 billion  
- **24-Hour Trading Volume**: $4.44 billion  
- **Volatility**: 2.6% (4H), 1.8% (24H)  

While SOLâ€™s price has yet to fully reflect its ecosystem momentum, analysts remain bullish on its long-term prospects.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

**Q: What is Real Economic Value (REV), and why does it matter for blockchains?**  
A: REV measures the monetary demand for using a blockchainâ€™s network, including transaction fees and tips. Higher REV indicates stronger user activity and network security, making it a critical metric for evaluating blockchain adoption.

**Q: How does Jito contribute to Solanaâ€™s revenue?**  
A: Jito enables staking of Solana assets across multiple networks, generating significant MEV revenue. This MEV market channels income to validators without raising fees, ensuring scalability and user affordability.

**Q: What are the implications of Solanaâ€™s TVL growth for DeFi?**  
A: TVL reflects the liquidity locked in a blockchainâ€™s DeFi protocols. Solanaâ€™s $8â€“$9 billion TVL demonstrates its growing role as a DeFi hub, offering faster and cheaper alternatives to Ethereum.

**Q: Why might companies consider Solana for treasury reserves?**  
A: Solanaâ€™s staking rewards allow companies to earn yield on treasury holdings without issuing new shares. Cantor Fitzgerald analysts argue this model could make Solana a preferred asset for corporate balance sheets.

**Q: How will the Alpenglow upgrade affect Solanaâ€™s performance?**  
A: Alpenglow aims to reduce finality to 100â€“150 milliseconds and lower validator costs, improving network efficiency and attracting developers seeking high throughput.

## Expanding Solanaâ€™s Ecosystem: Case Studies and Data

### Case Study: Jitoâ€™s Impact on MEV Markets

Jitoâ€™s dominance in Solanaâ€™s MEV landscape highlights the blockchainâ€™s maturity in capturing value from decentralized networks. By allowing cross-chain staking, Jito has created a competitive validator ecosystem, where rewards are distributed efficiently without compromising user experience.

### Comparative Analysis: Solana vs. Ethereum vs. Bitcoin

| Metric          | Solana       | Ethereum     | Bitcoin      |
|-----------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| REV (Jan 2025)  | $551M        | $410M        | $180M        |
| TVL (H1 2025)   | $8.5B        | $22B         | $500M        |
| DEX Volume Rank | #1           | #2           | Lower        |

This table illustrates Solanaâ€™s competitive edge in REV and DEX volume, while Ethereum maintains a lead in TVL due to its established DeFi ecosystem.
